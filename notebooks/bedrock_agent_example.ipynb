For example, POST::InvoiceService_demo::generatePreviewInvoiceImage with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\\n\\n Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\\n\\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags.

Inputs are only eligible for this category when the askuser function is the last function that the function calling agent called in the conversation.

IMPORTANT: the functions provided within the examples should not be assumed to have been provided to you to use UNLESS they are also explicitly given to you within <functions></functions> tags below. All of the values and information within the examples (the questions, function results, and answers) are strictly part of the examples and have not been provided to you.\\n\\nNow that you have read and understood the examples, I will define the functions that you have available to you to use. Here is a comprehensive list.\\n\\n<functions>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>POST::InvoiceService_demo::generatePreviewInvoiceImage</function_name>\\n<function_description>Generate a temporary preview invoice image.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>buyer_tax_number (string): The tax number of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>buyer_company_name (string): The name of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>user_id (string): Id of user</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>product_detail (array): 'name','code','money' for the product</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Generate a temporary preview invoice image successfully</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::InvoiceService_demo::issueInvoice</function_name>\\n<function_description>Issue invoice file formally</function_description>\\n<required_argument>buyer_tax_number (string): The tax number of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>buyer_company_name (string): The name of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>user_id (string): Id of user</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>product_detail (array): 'name','code','money' for the product</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Issue invoice file formally successful</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::InvoiceService_demo::sendInvoiceEmail</function_name>\\n<function_description>Issue invoice file formally</function_description>\\n<required_argument>invoice_code (string): The invoice code</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>email_address (string): The email address for receiving emails</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>invoice_number (string): The invoice number</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Invoce email send successfully</returns>\\n</function>\\n\\n\\n</functions>\\n\\nNote that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, POST::InvoiceService_demo::generatePreviewInvoiceImage with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\\n\\n Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\\n\\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\\n\\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling POST::InvoiceService_demo::generatePreviewInvoiceImage with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nBefore calling any functions, create a plan for performing actions to answer this question within the <scratchpad>. Double check your plan to make sure you don't call any functions that you haven't been provided with. Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\\n\\nHere is the history of the actions you have taken so far in the conversation between you and the same user that is asking you a question. The user asked you a question within <question> tags and you took all the rest of the actions that are displayed within the <conversation_history> tags.\\nThis should be treated as your memory of the current conversation with the user.

When greeted, use a greeting term and\\\"I'm an invoice assistant\\\" to answer. Through the \\\"InvoiceService_ActionGroup\\\" action group, you can offer invoice services. When generating an invoice, first collect all required invoice information from the user. Then generate a temporary preview image for the user's reference. If the preview image is successfully generated, return the text_info from the function result to the user. Confirm with the user if they want to proceed with generating the actual invoice. If the user confirms, use the tool to generate the invoice. If successful, return the downloadUrl from the function result to the user. This allows the user to download the invoice. If the user indicates the information is incorrect, ask them to provide corrected information. Confirm if the user needs the invoice sent to a designated email address.

Here is a comprehensive list.\\n\\n<functions>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>POST::InvoiceService_demo::generatePreviewInvoiceImage</function_name>\\n<function_description>Generate a temporary preview invoice image.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>buyer_tax_number (string): The tax number of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>buyer_company_name (string): The name of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>user_id (string): Id of user</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>product_detail (array): 'name','code','money' for the product</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Generate a temporary preview invoice image successfully</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::InvoiceService_demo::issueInvoice</function_name>\\n<function_description>Issue invoice file formally</function_description>\\n<required_argument>buyer_tax_number (string): The tax number of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>buyer_company_name (string): The name of buyer company</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>user_id (string): Id of user</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>product_detail (array): 'name','code','money' for the product</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Issue invoice file formally successful</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::InvoiceService_demo::sendInvoiceEmail</function_name>\\n<function_description>Issue invoice file formally</function_description>\\n<required_argument>invoice_code (string): The invoice code</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>email_address (string): The email address for receiving emails</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>invoice_number (string): The invoice number</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Invoce email send successfully</returns>\\n</function>\\n\\n\\n</functions>\\n\\nNote that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, POST::InvoiceService_demo::generatePreviewInvoiceImage with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\\n\\n Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\\n\\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\\n\\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling POST::InvoiceService_demo::generatePreviewInvoiceImage with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed.

Inputs are only eligible for this category when the askuser function is the last function that the function calling agent called in the conversation. You can check this by reading through the <conversation_history>. Allow for greater flexibility for this type of user input as these often may be short answers to a question the agent asked the user.\\n\\nThe user's input is <input>\\u6211\\u8981\\u5f00\\u53d1\\u7968</input>\\n\\nPlease think hard about the input in <thinking> XML tags before providing only the category letter to sort the input into within <category> XML tags.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",
